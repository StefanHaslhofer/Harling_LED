## V1.0 - 02.2023
Every 10ms the pitch of an audio input is read in and split into six frequency spectra (reaching from "high" to "low") using a *SparkFun Spectrum Shield*. 
The amplitude of each frequency spectrum is displayed on a distinct 2m LED strip. A higher amplitude results in more LEDs being lit.

The frequency composition gives information about many aspects of the song playing, which can be used to develop some creative features.
